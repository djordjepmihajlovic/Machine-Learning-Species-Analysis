\section*{Current progress}
To begin, we explored the training data provided. We looked at the number of data points, the number of
species, the number of observations for each species, and other statistical methods on the training data. Following we started with an exploratory analysis of the data, mainly focused on the distributions of observations for a few given species, calculating the largest and smallest span out of all species. We were also interested in the most commonly observed species and so we analysed all the species with the maximum number of observations and found in which continent these were most commonly observed. Next, we focused on a few different machine learning models and their application to
this data-set, with the goal of predicting the most likely species present at a given coordinate. The
models weâ€™ve used so far are Gaussian classification, k-nearest neighbours classification, decision
trees, and neural networks. We have also started evaluating the accuracy of our models, understanding and manipulating the test data provided was a big part in doing this.
