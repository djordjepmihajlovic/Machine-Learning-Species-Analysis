\section*{Future plans}
Our first goal moving forward is to determine which of the four models we’ve used so far is the ’best’. For this, we will evaluate each model using some accuracy measure and compare the scores. We are looking at the F1 score at the moment. Once the optimal model has been determined, our next task is to determine which species are most affected by climate change, by combining our model predictions with climate data from WorldClim. Current idea is to find areas with biggest temperature change and determine most common species in those areas through our models.
