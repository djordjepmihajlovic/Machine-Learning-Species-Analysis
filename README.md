# Machine Learning for Species Analysis
Applied Machine Learning Group Project

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary of project from AML homepage (https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/iaml/aml/mini-project/)

Youâ€™re an NGO looking into ecology and the preservation of animal species in the world. The data you have available to you is the geospatial distribution of animal sightings and prevalence, which identifies what species of animals have been seen where in the world. As part of the analyses into understanding what measures can be taken to help conservation efforts, there are a number of potential questions that one might consider, including

For any given species, where can one find them in the world?
For a given region in the world, what species may be observed there, and to what prevalence?
Can we answer such questions for multiple species or regions simultaneously?
The data has been processed for you in terms of train and test files already, including some additional training data if you would like to use it to explore different questions. A simple script that details how to load and minimally visualise this data is also included.
