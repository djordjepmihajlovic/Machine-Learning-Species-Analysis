Place to jot down ideas:

    1. (Dj) First q to address is predicting locations of species (I reckon we plot out these predicitions as a heatmap), 
    maybe overlay on actual map?

    2. (Dj) Could see if we could do image classification on species available (flora, fauna -> mammal, amphibian, reptile etc..) and then using our 
    predicted speices distn. predict possible diets of different species? (might be quite difficult but a possible idea after tackling
    initial questions)

    3. (Dj) Could predict animals most affected by climate change? (identify regions most affected then identify animals in those regions.)

    4. Learning how to use git with visual studio
